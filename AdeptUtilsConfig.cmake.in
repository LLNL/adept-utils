# - AdeptUtils: ADEPT Utiltity Libraries
#
#=============================================================================
# AdeptUtils is a library for code commonly used by LLNL tool projects.
# Currently it contains code for timing, dealing with matrices, and some
# useful headers for dealing with the STL in C++ tools.
#
#=== Usage ===================================================================
# This file allows Adept Utils to be automatically detected by other libraries
# using CMake.  To build with Adept Utils, you can do one of two things:
#
#   1. Set the AdeptUtils_DIR environment variable to the root of the Adept Utils
#      installation.  If you loaded AdeptUtils through a dotkit, this may already
#      be set, and AdeptUtils will be autodetected by CMake.
#
#   2. Configure your proeject with this option:
#      -D AdeptUtils_DIR=/path/to/dir/containing/this/file
#
# If you have done either of these things, then CMake should automatically find
# and include this file when you call find_package(AdeptUtils) from your
# CMakeLists.txt file.
#
#=== Components ==============================================================
# This library exports the following library targets, which you can link
# against in your project:
#
#   adept-timing    C timing library; contains machine definitions of get_time_ns()
#   adept-utils     Utility library; contains various other adept utilities.
#
# To link against these, just do, for example:
#
#   find_package(AdeptUtils REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(foo foo.c)
#   target_link_libraries(foo adept-timing)
#
# That's all!
